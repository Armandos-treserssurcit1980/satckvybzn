Man, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 A Working Man, and I gotta spill my guts about it. It's like, this dude's life plastered on screen in a way that hits too close to home, ya know? All that grind and trying to stay afloat — seriously, could feel my bones ache just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it. Lol, like, you ever have those moments where you're like, “Yep, that’s me”? Ugh, exhausting!

Guess what tho, the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 really nails that whole mundane routine vibe. Day in, day out, rinse, repeat. The struggle is real, dude. It kinda weirdly inspired me, but then made me want a nap too. 🤣 I dunno, sometimes  s are like tattoos — some reveal a deeper something, some are just there, poking at your soul. I had to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   'cause everyone's been talking about it non-stop, and I couldn't miss out on the buzz.

> That thing with the coworker and the damn vending machine, tho? Priceless. Had me cackling. It's funny 'cause, like, I swear that's the type of people you see when you work late-night shifts. Always something chaotic. Makes me appreciate my studio even more, where chaos is sorta my own doing lol.

And let's talk about Mike's teary moment, the kinda stuff that twists you up inside. Honestly, it got me thinking I should maybe, I dunno, sign up for yoga or something, chill that stress out. And then, how heavy it all gets — the man and his family, trying to juggle everything. So painfully real. Geez, that's why I do art. At least I can put a bit of myself out there without losing it completely... you know what I mean? Speaking of, I had to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , 'cause the 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 was super laggy at my place. Bleh, internet probs.

Anyway, maybe plan a   night or something? We could laugh and rant about how stupidly life imitates art or whatever. I could probably sketch some of the scenes too, just for kicks... as if I don't have a backlog of designs waiting to be inked already 😂

var crazyTalk = This line makes no sense, but it's here just because.; 

Anyway, I’m rambling, but guess it’s just one of those nights, huh? Movies and moods, weaving through the usual mess. Appreciate your ear, dude. Let me know if you dive into it — we can swap notes on who related harder 😄
